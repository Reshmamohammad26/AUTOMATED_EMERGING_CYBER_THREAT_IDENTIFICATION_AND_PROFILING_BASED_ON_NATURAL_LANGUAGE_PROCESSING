Project Title

Automated Emerging Cyber Threat Identification and Profiling based on Natural Language Processing

Description

This project focuses on automatically detecting, identifying, and profiling newly emerging cyber threats using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system analyzes real-time cybersecurity textual data such as news feeds, threat reports, blogs, vulnerability disclosures, dark web intel, security research papers etc., and extracts meaningful threat indicators.

Using advanced NLP techniques, the model classifies threat categories, identifies possible attack patterns, predicts threat impact level and generates structured profiles for early security awareness. This system helps cybersecurity analysts, SOC teams and researchers to quickly understand new threats before they widely spread.
